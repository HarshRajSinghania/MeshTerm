"""Purge simulator/test pollution from the default MeshTerm database.

``meshterm --mock`` (and headless test drives against the simulator) write to the
same ``~/.meshterm/meshterm.db`` as real radio sessions, so mock nodes leak into
the history that powers the mesh walk, the dashboard, and the trace suggestions. This
script removes exactly the rows carrying the simulator's fingerprints — the
:class:`MockDevice` identities in ``meshterm/core/connection.py`` — and nothing
else. Real rows never match: the fingerprints are fixed synthetic keys, the
``hopN`` placeholder hashes only the simulator emits, and the mock contact names.

A timestamped ``.bak`` copy of the database is written first; ``--dry-run`` only
reports what would go.
